# Contact Api with Docker Compose

This basic api returns contact information, providing the ability to return a list of multiple contacts and an individual contact.

## Description

The purpose of this code is to:

- Demonstrate the use of docker to run a dotnet api which returns information from an mssql database all within containers
- Run functional tests of an api using a actual sql database rather than alternatives such as an Entity Framework In Memory database

The application and database schema are simple to allow the focus to remain on the dockerfile and dockercompose files.
